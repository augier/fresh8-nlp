Froome’s defence makes good sense

The cyclist’s account of his use of an anti-asthma drug is not suspicious, says Dr Simon James Woods

Chris Froome deserves to be allowed to put his salbutamol control behind him (Sport, 6 July). I was disappointed to see your correspondent sow a seed of doubt about a “contradictory” account of why Froome (or anyone for that matter) would use increased doses of the anti-asthma drug during an exacerbation of symptoms.

The Union Cycliste Internationale suggested he “significantly increased his dose” to treat a chest infection; Froome stated there was an “acute worsening of my asthma”.

These things are entirely synonymous: we often refer to it as an infective exacerbation of asthma. I appreciate that it’s pretty likely that we haven’t seen the end of doping in cycling, but in this instance it really does look like everything adds up.
