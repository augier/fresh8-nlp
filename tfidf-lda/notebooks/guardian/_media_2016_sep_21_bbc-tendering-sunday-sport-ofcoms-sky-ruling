And so it begins. The first shows to be tendered out by the BBC to independent producers have been revealed, and the era of 100%!c(MISSING)ompetition to make (most) BBC programming kicks off.

First up for grabs to indie producers will be Songs of Praise, Question of Sport, Horizon and Holby City. The BBC says the choice of shows was down to their commissioning cycles but they seem strangely appropriate. All are much loved, and well known, but not quite the crown jewels of Strictly or EastEnders.

It’s now down to Mark Linsey and his team at BBC Studios to work which of these programmes they want to keep making, and how many contracts they will be able to win.
