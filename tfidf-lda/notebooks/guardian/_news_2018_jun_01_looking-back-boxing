Looking back: boxing

29 June 1914: US boxer Jack Johnson beats Frank Moran in Paris. The match was quite a society event and perhaps the most singular feature was the extraordinary number of women spectators, most of them in evening dress.

22 December 1920: Immovable boxer and kinema ‘king’: The middle-aged bald little man is the US boxer Johnny Coulon, who is mystifying Paris by his uncanny power to stay on his legs.

28 March 1958: Floyd Patterson, the sleeping giant of boxing. The world heavyweight champion has to be woken by his manager as British fight fans wait to greet him.

26 March 1963: Boxer Davey Moore dies three days after title, stirring debate on whether boxing should be banned.

29 April 1967: Champion heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali is stripped of world title after refusing to fight in Vietnam war.

2 October 1975: After one of the most incredible matches in boxing history, Muhammad Ali will find it hard to step away from the ring.

13 April 1981: Joe Louis, the greatest of the heavyweights, dies. The boxer astounded the sporting world with a record succession of defences of the world heavyweight title, 26 in all.

25 March 1995: Pat Putnam in New York on Mike Tyson, the reformed convert to Islam, who is released from prison today, having served less than three years of his six-year sentence for rape.

6 May 2017: She was the golden girl of London 2012 and Rio, before going pro. But the boxer has never talked about the most difficult time in her life – until now. Simon Hattenstone interviews Nicola Adams.

2 November 2017: Float like a butterfly, sing like a soprano ... how Muhammad Ali’s epic life became an opera.
