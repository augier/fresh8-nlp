Tony Greaves asks for Israel to be treated like other states (Letters, 26 June) on the very day that Britain, after a wait of 70 years, treats Israel like other states with a first royal visit.

• If Peter Hanson (Letters, 26 June) just crossed the Bristol Channel, he would find that, very sensibly, his butterflies have decamped to the Gower peninsula. Walking on the cliffs over the last week I’ve been besieged by butterflies of all kinds – clearly they have realised that a better lifestyle is on offer over the border in Wales.

• Re the unexpected delivery of 4,500 doughnuts to Old Trafford cricket ground (Sport, 26 June). It’s a pity Jack Simmons is not still playing as he could have polished them off after a fish and chips lunch.

• Your feature on the rise of cup sizes (Bra-vo!, 26 June) reminds me of an intriguing question. In my gym-going days I was always fascinated that quite a lot of women put their bras on back-to-front and then twisted them round. Presumably this made them easier to fasten. Does this still happen?

• Helen Major (Letters, 26 June) asks whether other Morris Minors have been used by gangsters. Niall Griffiths’ excellent novel Wreckage follows two pitiful Liverpool gangsters marauding around north Wales in an increasingly battered Moggy. It doesn’t end well for them or it.
