Andy Murray on Monday pledged his winnings at this year’s Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club – which will be more than £346,000 if he wins his sixth title on Sunday – to the families of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy.

When he won the Queen’s Club title in 2013, Murray donated his £73,000 winner’s purse to the Royal Marsden Hospital, who successfully treated his friend, the former doubles player Ross Hutchins, for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The tournament , the most prestigious on grass in the leadup to Wimbledon, has since been upgraded to an ATP500 event.

The world No1 joins the Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin, who said on Saturday that he would give £50 to the fund for every minute he plays at the European Under-21 Championship in Poland. If Spain, the tournament favourites, reach the final, they will have played five matches and Bellerin’s contribution could be as high as £22,500.

The Manchester City midfielder Raheem Sterling has also promised to give “a substantial sum”.

Ascot Racecourse is also making a donation of £100,000 to The British Red Cross UK Solidarity and London Fire Relief Funds and Local Charities, to support those affected.

Johnny Weatherby, Chairman of Ascot Racecourse, said: “We have all been deeply saddened by recent tragic events around the country. At the beginning of this important week for racing, we at Ascot Racecourse wish to pay our respects to the victims and offer support to the families who have been so terribly affected.”
