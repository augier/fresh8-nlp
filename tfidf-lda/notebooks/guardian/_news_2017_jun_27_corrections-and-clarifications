Corrections and clarifications

• An article about whistleblowers being deterred in British sports quoted a damning verdict from accountants Moore Stephens on UK Sport’s whistleblower policies. The quote was actually in reference to British Cycling and not UK Sport (Don’t blame whistleblowers but loaded seats of power, 19 June, page 12, Sport).

• Manchester’s Christie hospital won’t be the first in the UK to receive a high-energy proton beam cancer therapy machine, as we said in an article last week (Cyclotron offers cutting-edge therapy for NHS cancer patients, 23 June, page 19). From early 2018 Rutherford Cancer Centre in Newport will be the first high-energy proton beam therapy centre in the UK. Christie hospital will be the first NHS hospital to use the treatment from August 2018.
