Darren Lehmann to quit – reports

Hello there. Australia is waking up to reports that Darren Lehmann, the coach, will resign from his position in the next 24 hours, as the ball tampering scandal that has rocked the sport appears set to claim its first victim.

The coach’s position has come under intense scrutiny since captain Steve Smith’s admission that his team conspired to tamper with the ball during the third Test in Cape Town.

CA CEO James Sutherland will land in Johannesburg on Tuesday morning local time to join head of integrity Iain Roy and performance manager Pat Howard, who have been tasked with undertaking an investigation into the incident. A press conference is expected that evening when sanctions against Smith, his vice-captain David Warner and Cameron Bancroft are likely to be announced.

The report in the UK’s Daily Telegraph claimed Lehmann had already tendered his resignation, a move that in part prompted Sutherland to fly to South Africa on Monday.

Smith and his vice-captain David Warner have been stood down from the remainder of the current Test, pending the internal investigation into the incident.

Lehmann has insisted he had no prior knowledge of the ball tampering plan, but has come under fierce criticism as the veracity of those claims were tested. The overall culture of his team has also come under the microscope in the wake of the incident, leading many to call for his head.

Stay with us for developments.
