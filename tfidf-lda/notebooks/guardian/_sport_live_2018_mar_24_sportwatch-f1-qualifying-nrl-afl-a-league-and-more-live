Preamble

Good evening (if you’re on the east coast of Australia), good afternoon (if you’re in Perth), and whatever you’re having yourself if you are elsewhere on the continent or the world. And what a packed day of sport we have coming up. The Western Bulldogs have already won the AFLW grand final and the magnificent mare Winx has broken the world record for group one flat wins. We’ve also got NRL, AFL, A-League and formula one qualifying.

And there was also the little manner of a Nordic humiliation in football overnight.
