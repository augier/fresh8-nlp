It’s all over at the MCG and it’s the Cats with an important win over Collingwood. It wasn’t quite the tight, exciting contest we were all hoping for, but Collingwood can go away happy with how they’ve performed despite the loss. They’ll need to address inaccuracy issues, and have again been struck down with injury, but certainly showed excellent effort.

For the Cats, it was critical that they got the win with a bit of a logjam on the ladder. They’re now up to third on the ladder, largely due to percentage: they’re one of six clubs on 20 points now – all the way down to Port in eighth.

Dangerfield (26 disposals, 12 contested possessions, seven tackles), Stewart (28 disposals, 12 contested possessions, nine marks and seven rebound 50s) and Menegola (24 disposals, 10 marks, three goals) starred for the Cats on an enjoyable Mother’s Day for Geelong fans.

Thanks for joining me for today’s AFL blog and I’ll see you back here next weekend!

Welcome

Hello everyone and welcome to this live blog of the Mother’s Day clash between Collingwood and Geelong. We’ve already had some excellent games this round: the showdown between Port Adelaide v Adelaide probably the highlight, closely followed by Hawthorn v Sydney. Currently we also have a very tight tussle between the Kangaroos and Tigers unfolding, so we’ll hope this one lives up to expectations.

Late change: Collingwood have withdrawn captain Scott Pendlebury. Don’t think anyone’s very surprised by that one. Gary Ablett of course returns to the Geelong side, and is a big plus given Tom Hawkins is out for making contact with an umpire last week.

Jamie Elliot has also reportedly re-done his hamstring in the VFL, so that’s very bad news for the Pies.

I’ll come back to you shortly with an update on North Melbourne v Richmond!
