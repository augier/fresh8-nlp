5.30 Champion Bumper (2m 1/2f)

A benefit for Willie Mullins over the years, the Irishman having won it eight times, albeit not since 2013. He fields Blackbow and Carefully Selected (10-1), among others, and both of those are easy to like for their unbeaten records in such races. Blackbow has had much the greater support from punters so far. Crooks Peak won here in November, a race that has worked out well, though his stable has been quiet since then. Felix Dejsy represents Gordon Elliott. He’s well fancied but made hard work of it last time and the placed horses have been beaten again since then. Didtheyleaveuoutto is closely related to Denman and won an Ascot bumper that can sometimes prove influential.

Betting latest: Blackbow 5-1, Rhinestone 11-2, Acey Milan 6-1, Felix Desjy 15-2, Carefully Selected 8-1, Didtheyleaveuoutto 12-1, Tornado Flyer 12-1, Know The Score 16-1, 20-1 bar

4.50 Fred Winter Juvenile hHndicap (2m 1/2f)

Another tricky handicap in which the trickiness lies in measuring the ability of four-year-olds with hardly any form to their names. Paul Nicholls has won this twice in the last three years and fields Act Of Valour, beaten only by the classy We Have A Dream when last seen. Nube Negra has won two hurdles starts easily and given best only to Apple’s Shakira, the Triumph favourite, in the other. Oxford Blu is thought to be a contender by his young trainer, Olly Murphy, who has begun his career with a bang, but this is one who could be vulnerable on a testing surface. Eragon De Chanay (9-1) bolted up at Sandown at the weekend, allowing him to sneak in at the bottom of the weights. If he can run to his best for the second time in five days, he has a big chance.

Betting latest: Mitchouka 8-1, Nube Negra 17-2, Look My Way 9-1, Eragon De Chanay 9-1, Lisp 10-1, The King Of May 11-1, Style De Garde 14-1, Act of Valour 14-1, Oxford Blue 14-1, 16-1 bar
