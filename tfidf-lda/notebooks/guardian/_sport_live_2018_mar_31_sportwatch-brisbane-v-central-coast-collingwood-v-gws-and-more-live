Preamble

Good evening readers and welcome to the Guardian’s sportwatch on a much too hot Saturday (where I am anyway).

But is anyone paying attention to any sport other than cricket today? I hope so, or I’m going to be lonesome for the next five hours.

Two of the three most read stories on Guardian Australia today are about David Warner’s press conference. If you’re a sport fan, you’ve probably already read it, but just in case, here is our news report.
