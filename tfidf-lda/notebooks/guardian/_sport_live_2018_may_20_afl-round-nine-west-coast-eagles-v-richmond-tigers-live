AFL: Eagles soar to the top of the ladder after big win over Tigers – as it happened

West Coast 20.10 (130) defeat Richmond 12.11 (83)

Wow. That was some statement from the Eagles. It’s their eighth-straight victory, and they’re now a game clear on the top of the table, relegating the reigning premiers to second and taking a chunk out of their percentage. Jack Darling had a career-high six goals and 21 disposals, but for me it was Elliot Yeo who stole the show with 29 disposals including 15 contested possessions, 10 clearances and seven inside 50s. He looked like he was out of the game in the first quarter, and came back in electrifying fashion. After the game he admits he might have something to worry about after scans during the week: unbelievable to think he performed like that after some kind of injury.

Thanks for joining me for this Sunday liveblog, and I look forward to seeing you back here next weekend.

Welcome

Hello there and welcome to this top of the table clash between the West Coast Eagles and the Richmond Tigers at Optus Stadium in Perth.

I’ll admit I’m one of those (idiots) who wrote off the Eagles at the start of the season, not even bothering to mention them amongst my main contenders for the Premiership in 2018. I remember one WA reader commenting below the line and saying that the West Aussie teams were used to being written off, and that was just the way they liked it. Well, I’ve learned my lesson and have jumped back on the bandwagon today: I reckon they have every chance of knocking off the ladder-leaders at home.

Jack Higgins is the late out for the Tigers with Shaun Grigg his replacement. The Eagles will go in unchanged.

p.s. good news AFL fans – comments on the blog are OPEN! You can thank me later.
