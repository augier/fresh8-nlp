Thankyou for reading

Thanks for joining me for the grand final rematch between the Giants and Lightning, the match lived up to its hype, with the Giants impressive and the Lightning perhaps missing Laura Langman. It’ll be interesting to see how they rebound next week. Imagine those two sides might find themselves at the pointy end of the ladder come the end of the season.

There’s one more match to wrap up the first round of the season – between the NSW Swifts and Queensland Firebirds. I hope we’ll be able to bring you some more netball action very shortly.

Enjoy your Sunday! If you’re looking for AFL or NRL results, keep an eye on the website for a wrap-up report. I’ll be back here next week blogging some more live sport!

Other rule changes

“Several other rule changes were unveiled this week. As in basketball, team officials and bench players will be allowed to walk the sideline to talk to players and the number of time-outs has been doubled; from one per team, per half to two, meaning there could be as many as eight time-outs a match. The breaks between quarters have also been increased by a few minutes.”
