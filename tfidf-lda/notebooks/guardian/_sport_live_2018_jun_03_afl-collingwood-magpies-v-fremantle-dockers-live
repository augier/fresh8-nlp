See you next week

Thanks so much for joining me for what was sadly a blowout game between the Pies and Dockers. We’ll have a column from Craig Little tomorrow wrapping up this Indigenous round’s action, so look out for that. I’m also working something up on next round’s Pride match.

I’ll see you next week for another blog – hopefully we can get some netball in this time!
