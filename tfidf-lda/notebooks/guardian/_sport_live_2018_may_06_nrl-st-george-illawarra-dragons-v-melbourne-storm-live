St George Illawarra Dragons defeat Melbourne Storm 34-14

Game finishes with a conversion to Widdop after Smith kicks the ball over the sideline from the dropout. Hasn’t been his day.

The Dragons couldn’t have played a more impressive game, really, despite all the errors. To beat the Storm by such a comprehensive margin, and to force them into so many of their own errors with excellent pressure has surely proved them the real deal for this season.

There’s an almighty roar from the crowd at the conclusion, while the Strom boys cut dejected figures. Widdop says his team made some silly errors but to beat Melbourne is “extra difficult” and they’re very pleased. Billy Slater, for the losing side, says today wasn’t the Storm’s day and acknowledges there was a momentum shift after the no try in the first half. Doesn’t use it as an excuse though: “some go for you, some go against you”.

Finally, Ben Hunt says his side are “starting to believe”. “It’s a long way to go but we’re building”. Indeed. Very impressive stuff from the Dragons.

Thanks for joining me today – we’ll have an NRL column for you tomorrow morning to look forward to. Otherwise I’ll see you here next week for another Sunday sport blog.

Welcome

Hello everyone and welcome to this hotly-anticipated clash between the ladder-leading Dragons and last year’s premiers, the Melbourne Storm. Fair to say this is the most looked forward to game of the 2018 season, while of course these teams have history; the Dragons’ 1999 grand final capitulation to the Storm one that stands out. Their coach today, Paul McGregor, was co-captain that day and will be keen to emerge on top today with the Storm looking a little more vulnerable than in recent years thanks partly to the departure of Cooper Cronk.

It’s not a stretch to say this could even be the grand final preview for this year – with apologies to the Roosters amongst perhaps a couple others.

There’s a few tantalising match-ups to watch today: Matt Dufty lines up on his self-proclaimed hero in Billy Slater, Cameron McInness will match up with his namesake, Cam Smith, in yet another audition for his spot in the NSW side, while Ben Hunt, in scintillating form, has the edge on his opposite and less-experienced halfback: Ryley Jacks.

The Storm have a debutant today in Papua New Guinean Justin Olam, who is a 24-year-old rookie. The Dragons on the other hand are without injury concerns, one part of the equation in their impressive form this season.

Should be a tight one – I’m going for the Storm, just, probably only because I’m a Victorian.
