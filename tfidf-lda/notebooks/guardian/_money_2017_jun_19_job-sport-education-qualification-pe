Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

My partner began a degree in PE and education but never completed it, partly because the course wasn’t right for him.

After travelling abroad and doing a series of seemingly random jobs, he is back in the UK and working in an engineering job, which pays minimum wage, is physically demanding and dangerous at times.

He wants a new job, ideally in sport and education but is struggling to even get interviews. He is looking into doing a qualification – either starting at night school or potentially doing his degree again part-time over many years.

Given his interest and tuition so far in PE and education, what sort of qualification would help him get the biggest return in the shortest time? And what sort of jobs should he be applying for bearing in mind he has to cut his cloth accordingly?
