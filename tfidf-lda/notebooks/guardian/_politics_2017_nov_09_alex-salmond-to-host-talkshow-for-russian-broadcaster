Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, is to present a political talkshow on Russian-state owned broadcaster RT.

The announcement was condemned by Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who described it as an “unedifying spectacle” and said Salmond was “a former first minister who fancies himself as the Michael Parkinson of [Vladimir] Putin’s propaganda channel”.

RT has been criticised as a propaganda tool for Putin’s government, a claim that has been mocked by the channel through a series of adverts.

The Alex Salmond Show will involve current affairs discussions and interviews with guests, covering politics, showbiz and sport. It will start next Thursday and will air weekly.

The programme was inspired by Salmond’s sell-out performances at the Edinburgh festival during the summer. “I am delighted to be bringing the Alex Salmond Show to an international platform,” Salmond said. “After 30 years in elected politics and at the sharp end of interviews, I’m really looking forward to turning the tables and having the opportunity to see things from a new perspective.

“Of course, the show will have a sharp focus on politics, but I am not interested in catching people out but in finding out much more about the personalities which lie behind their public positions. My view is that the viewer will gain far more information and entertainment from a relaxed, informal style which allows them to express their point of view.”

Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT, said: “For the last 30 years Alex Salmond has been seen in halls of power the world over. We are proud to bring his knowledge, wit, and political nous to a new home here on RT.”
