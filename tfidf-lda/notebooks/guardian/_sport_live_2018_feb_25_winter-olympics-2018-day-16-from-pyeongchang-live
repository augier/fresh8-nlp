Winter Olympics 2018: day 16 from Pyeongchang – as it happened

Well, that almost concludes the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, with just the closing ceremony to come. We’ll have a separate liveblog of the closing ceremony, as well as final official results, so please do stick around for that, but here’s a summary of the key events of the last day.

Bjoergen also became the most successful Winter Olympian ever with eight gold, four silver, and three bronze.

Norway finish on 14 gold!

Thankyou for joining me, but please do hang around for our closing ceremony live blog and official wrap-up later.
