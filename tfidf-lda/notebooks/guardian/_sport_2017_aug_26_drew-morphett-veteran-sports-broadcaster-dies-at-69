The veteran sports broadcaster Drew Morphett has died.

Morphett, aged 69, was found dead at his home in Victoria last night.

He became a fixture in many homes through his calling of the AFL for Channel Seven.

Morphett began at the ABC in 1966, and spent long stints at the public broadcaster and Channel Seven throughout his career.

He was also known for his cricket coverage and for calling several Olympic games.

Morphett was the long-time host of ABC televisionâ€™s The Winners program, popular in the 1980s, which was relaunched on Foxtel more recently.

He retired from full-time broadcasting last year.

News of his death prompted an outpouring of tributes and condolence from players, colleagues and friends.

He was variously described as a talented, kind-hearted broadcaster, and a great storyteller and enthusiastic mentor for younger staff.
