Here’s a reminder of what to look for tonight.

Later tonight - starting at 7.00pm we’ll have more medal action in the swimming and cycling. There are nine gold medals up for grabs in the pool, and four in the velodrome.

From 5.30pm we’ll have Australia’s men’s and women’s basketball teams making their first appearance. The Boomers in particular have a massive opening game against Canada.

There’s still two more weightlifting medals to come, and the women’s artistic gymnastics which is underway now.

Thanks for following along!

Welcome to day two

Hi there! Welcome to day two.

The pool and the velodrome were where it was at yesterday, with a total of 13 gold on offer in the swimming and cycling. For the Australians, Mack Horton won gold in the pool while the men and women both claimed gold in the 4,000m team pursuit race.

But it was England who ended the day on top of the medal tally, with Aimee Willmott and Max Whitlock among the gold for England. You can check out our medal tally here.

There’s plenty of action to get to today though, so let’s not mess about.

We’ve already had one gold medal so far, with India’s Sanjita Chanu Khumukcham taking out the women’s 53kg weightlifting final. India also took out gold in the final of the women’s 48kg category on day one.

In the pool, Olympic champion and world record holder Adam Peaty has qualified the fastest for the men’s 100m breaststroke semi-final. England have also started their hockey campaign well with a 7-0 win against Malaysia.

The big drama though has been at the lawn bowls, where we’ve seen the first big upset of the Games. The highly-rated Australian men’s triples team has gone down to ... Jersey. Ouch.

Coming up

Here’s what’s still to come on day two. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.

At 4.00pm Australia’s Georgia Goodwin - a Gold Coast native - will be in the medal hunt in the women’s artistic gymnastics final.

From 5.30pm we’ll have Australia’s men’s and women’s basketball teams making their first appearance. The Boomers in particular have a massive opening game against Canada.

The men’s 69kg weightlifting final is kicking off now.

From 3.30pm Australia and England will make their Games debuts in the beach volleyball, taking place on the Coolangatta beachfront. Should be speccy.

Later tonight - starting at 7.00pm we’ll have more medal action in the swimming and cycling. There are nine gold medals up for grabs in the pool, and four in the velodrome.
