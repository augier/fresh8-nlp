As expected, we are off for the day here at the Oval

James Hildreth has just registered his 43rd first class century with another elegant cut to the vacant third man boundary. He was dropped once on 24, a relatively easy chance to mid-wicket spilt by Fidel Edwards. Had the chance been held Somerset would have been 71-5. Hildreth’s hundred, his second of he season, took 138 balls and was punctuated by 13 fours. Somerset now have the initiative with Overton opening his shoulders at the other end: 260-5.

I said there was no sign of Abbott. But that situation has changed. Quite heroically, he has resurfaced after tea and is gingerly making his way up to the wicket now. He is clearly not fully fit and the ball is 55 overs old; in his first two overs he has yielded 14 runs. But he’s giving it a go. Overton has sped to 58 and Somerset are about to take the lead.

All was serenity at Taunton as Hildreth and Davies took the score to 131-4, whereupon Davies left the field alongside the physio. We gather that he has a “sore foot”. One of Somerset’s reserve keepers is not playing, Trescothick. Now Gregory has played on against Brad Wheal so its 134-5 and there is uncertainty when/if Davies will return. So far Hampshire have been able to rotate their three fit bowlers and this turnover of batsmen may give them fresh energy. Brad has good wheels, as they say.

So far this match has been more memorable for Abell the bowler than the batsman. Just before lunch Abell was caught off a top-edged hook off Gareth Berg for a duck. It was a frenetic morning: six wickets, 119 runs and there is no sign that Hildreth and Davies are in a mind to grind away in the afternoon session. By the way, this is an excellent surface for cricket with encouragement for bowlers, but it’s still possible to play some shots. There is pace so that the nicks carry, which may explain why Gareth Berg opened the bowling after lunch with four slips and a gully to Davies.

Greetings (belated) from Taunton. I’ve not missed a ball but have been distracted (old players’ dinner last night and there are still a few around, then lost my glasses). More importantly the game is moving on with some rapidity.

Hampshire had an early morning flurry to be bowled out for 231 and Somerset are currently 68-2. Just as significant as the figures is an injury to Kyle Abbott, the South African seamer, who has left the field. Conditions were useful for him, but chasing a ball at mid-off he turned an ankle. He left the field immediately and has not been sighted since, a major blow to Hampshire.

The ball is still swinging and two of Somerset’s youngsters have departed to fine deliveries. Eddie Byrom was bowled by Fidel Edwards and George Bartlett caught at slip off Brad Wheal. Matt Renshaw, who, I discover, when he opened his locker upon arrival at Taunton, found it bulging with sandpaper, has played some cracking shots – an uppercut six among them, has also had some luck; he was dropped on 15 behind the wicket and was very close to lbw against Edwards.

If Somerset can occupy the crease for a while expect captain James Vince to do some bowling, hoping to emulate the heroics of Tom Abell on Friday. They do not appear to be set on crease occupation at the moment however. Renshaw and Hildreth are playing lots of shots … and he’s just been caught at slip off Berg for 36. It’s 71-3.
