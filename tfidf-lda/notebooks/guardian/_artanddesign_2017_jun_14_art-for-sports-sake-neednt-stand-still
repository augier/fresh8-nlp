While Simon Burnton is critical of sporting statues (Sporting statues too often become a busted flush, Sport, 12 June), artists are increasingly using a wide range of media to celebrate or critique sport.

Regarding football, I recommend Jason Minsky’s video piece that begins with a shot of an expansive sea and the occasional cry of a seagull and it then closes in to an assistant referee excitedly waving his flag, while standing on a floating corner of a football pitch. While it could perhaps be seen as depicting such officials as “all at sea”, the clue to this beautifully filmed conceptual piece is in the title – Mare Liberum.
