Afternoon everyone, so it’s that time of the year when the planets align in a rare conjunction of the codes and the domestic league, union, football and AFL competitions all play at the same time. With the Commonwealth Games as well, there’s more sport around than you can shake a stick at – and there’s even some hockey on at the Gold Coast if professional stick-shaking is your thing. Speaking of which, check out Richard Parkin’s Commonwealth Games blog for all the action on that front – this blog is Gold Coast free.

And just to immediately undermine my own comment, we already have one Gold Coast result today with the Titans beating the Sea Eagles 32-20 in the NRL at Gladstone. But that’s my last Gold Coast report. Apart from the AAP match report I’ll probably put up after this. But then that’s definitely it. Probably. And in the AFL, Richmond (15.12) 102 have overcome the Hawks (12.10) 82.

“But Gadsby”, you rudely interrupt, “forget about what’s already happened, what else is coming up this evening?” Well that’s an excellent question and, by pure coincidence, it allows me to do a run-down. Let’s have a look-see.

NRL

The decidedly un-electric Eels will attempt to lift themselves off the foot of the ladder against the Panthers, who can leap up to third with a victory at ANZ Stadium. Can Parramatta stop their season from slipping away before it’s even begun? Over to you Brad Arthur.

AFL

I’ll be diving straight into the Bulldogs v Bombers game shortly after this preamble. Spolier alert: the Bulldogs are winning. After that I’ll be using the latest Guardian technology (a Stargate-style portal) to head to Perth with my trusty Commodore 64 laptop for action from the intriguing clash between the Eagles and the Cats.

A-League

As the other codes jostle for position at the start of the race, the A-League reaches end game. To that end, Wellington Phoenix’s fight to avoid the wooden spoon sees them head to Melbourne to face the Victory. Then it’s over to newly crowned premiership champions Sydney FC (can they be newly crowned if they won last year too?) for their clash against Adelaide. We’re sure party animal Graham Arnold has already put up the bunting and popped open the champagne. You know what he’s like.
